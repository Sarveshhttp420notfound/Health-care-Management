I’m building a multi-phase system to modernize healthcare services across hospitals and clinics, including:

🧑‍⚕️ Patient & Doctor Management – Centralized profiles, appointments, and treatment history

📅 Appointment Scheduling & Hospital Workflow – Efficient scheduling and resource allocation

🏥 Medical Records & Documentation – Digital storage for prescriptions, invoices, and reports

📊 Analytics & Reporting – Patient trends, hospital utilization, and performance dashboards

⚡ AI & Automation – Proposed AI-driven health insights and alerts for critical patients

Tech Stack:

💻 Java | Spring Boot | Microservices | Apache Kafka | SQL

🐳 Docker | Kubernetes | Jenkins | Ansible

📊 Grafana | SonarQube | AWS & more
